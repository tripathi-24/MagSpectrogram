  Mean interval: 3.750000 seconds
  Median interval: 3.750000 seconds
  Std deviation: 0.000000 seconds

Calculated sampling rate: 0.266667 Hz
Expected from filename (Downsample_60): 0.016667 Hz

🎯 SUMMARY:
📈 Sampling Rate: 0.266667 Hz
📊 Nyquist Frequency: 0.133333 Hz
```

## 🎯 **File Requirements**

Your CSV file should have these columns:
- **timestamp**: Date/time of measurements
- **b_x, b_y, b_z**: Magnetic field components (nT)
- **sensor_id**: Optional, for multi-sensor analysis

## 💡 **Tips**

1. **File Selection**: Use the browse button to navigate to your CSV file
2. **Large Files**: The analysis runs in a separate thread, so the GUI won't freeze
3. **Export Results**: Save your analysis results for future reference
4. **Multiple Files**: You can analyze different files by selecting new ones
5. **Error Handling**: Clear error messages if something goes wrong

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**
## 🎛️ New Spectrogram Options (30 Oct 2025)

- Normalize per-frequency (row-wise): ON by default. Stabilizes colors across time and prevents early bright patches from compressing later segments to purple.
- Stable percentile scaling: ON by default. Computes contrast percentiles on the middle of the spectrogram (trimming edge columns) to avoid edge transients dominating. Adjustable “Trim edge time bins”.
- Safer enhancement: The signal is standardized then scaled with a capped factor to avoid overflow/saturation. Default factor reduced.
- Gamma correction: OFF by default.
- Global z-score: OFF by default.

Practical notes:
- If later time looks uniformly purple, keep per-frequency normalization and stable scaling ON, reduce enhancement, and keep gamma/z-score OFF.
- Y-axis frequency limits: you can set max_freq up to Nyquist (fs/2). Minimum resolvable frequency ≈ 1 / window_seconds (use longer windows for μHz–mHz).


### **If GUI doesn't start:**
```bash
# Install tkinter (if needed)
sudo apt-get install python3-tk  # Ubuntu/Debian
brew install python-tk           # macOS with Homebrew
```

### **If analysis fails:**
- Check that your CSV file has the required columns
- Ensure the timestamp column is properly formatted
- Verify the file isn't corrupted
